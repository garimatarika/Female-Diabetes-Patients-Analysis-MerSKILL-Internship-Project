# Female-Diabetes-Patients-Analysis-MerSKILL-Internship-Project

This is my second task of MeriSKILL Data Analyst Internship. I'm sharing the results of "Female Diabetes Patients Analysis".
The source of Dataset is The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
👩‍🏫 Objective : To diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset and predict the possibilities having diabetes indications for future preference.

💻 Tools Used : Excel, PostgreSQL, Power BI

📜 Analysis Discussion :

🌡 Health Status Update: Out of 100% survey of this Dataset, we have 47.73% females to be Diabetic and 34.3% are Prediabetic(likely to be diabetic if not remain aware)
whereas only 17.97% are found in normal health condition.

🤰 Health mode during Pregnancy : Sum of pregnancy is most during the Age (20-39) i.e. 1584 (Its an approximate group formation)
Out of which 543 are Diabetic , 617 are Pre-Diabetic and 424 are normal.

Total Pregnancies: 2953

BMI vs weight status: Generally, BMI range -weight status
(18.5-24.9 Healthy weight )
(25.0-29.9 Over weight)
(30.0 above Obese weight)
Our Report data

Age Group Healthy weight Over weight Obese weight
A(20-39) 3 22 134
B(40-59) 3 17 78
C(60-79) 1 1 7


Count of Outcome by age group :
Group A : 84%
Group B : 22.79%
Group C : 4.04%

We can check different parameters and results for particular age group by using slicer on upper right corner.
KPIs shows the total pregnancies, Max Blood Pressure observed in females during this survey and average age.

Conclusion : Diabetes is most likely to be in patients with higher BMI range, high glucose level.
BMI range shows that healthy weight is found min while there is greater percentage of over weight and obese weight.
Most outcomes are in age group A (20-39)
